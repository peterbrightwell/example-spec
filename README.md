# Example AMWA Informative Specification [Work In Progress]

This is a dummy specification to demonstrate AMWA's process.

## Why does this exist?

AMWA's [BCP-001] describes a process for developing AMWA specifications:

- Build up as as Work In Progress (WIP)
- Elevate to Proposed Specification when "ready to implement".
- Elevate to Specification when implementations are mature

AMWA are currently looking at a possible revision to BCP-001 that suits the "API" nature of many specifications (such as NMOS IS-04/05/06). It should make it easier to answer questions such as:

 - When should I start implementing?
 - How do I know it won't change in the future?
 - Which specifications are required with / work with which?

## Why do we need multiple versions of specs?

Two obvious reasons are to **add features** and **fix bugs** (problems) in the specification. For this example repository we'll keep lists of features and bug fixes in this README and update the lists as we make new versions.

## ~~Creatures~~ Features

- Aardvark

## Bug fixes

- Ant
- Bee
- Cicada
